[probe]
pin: ^SB2040v2:LIMIT_0 # Use the high voltage port Limit_0 for Induction probes.
#   Probe detection pin. If the pin is on a different microcontroller
#   than the Z steppers then it enables "multi-mcu homing". This
#   parameter must be provided.
#deactivate_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should execute deactivation gcode
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. The default is True.
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   x-axis. The default is 0.
y_offset: -3.0
#   The distance (in mm) between the probe and the nozzle along the
#   y-axis. The default is 0
#   The distance (in mm) between the bed and the nozzle when the probe
#   triggers. This parameter must be provided.
speed: 5.0
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when probing. The default is 5mm/s.
samples: 3
#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
lift_speed: 10
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
samples_result: median
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
samples_tolerance_retries: 3
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
